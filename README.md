**Server part written in Node.js.**<br>
**Client part is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.**

<br>

## Setup

### Step 1: Launching *server*

Install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In terminal open `ConnectFourServer` folder.

Run command `npm install`.

Run command `npm run start`.

---

### Launching *web client*

The *web client* must be running on *web server* because the [**CORS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) security system does not allow the browser to run JavaScript files from your computer.

You can use [**MAMP**](https://www.mamp.info/en), or similar servers. Or run a web client using [**WebStorm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (it runs projects through its own *web server*).
